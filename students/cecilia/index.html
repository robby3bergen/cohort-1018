    <h2>Some facts about her</h2>
    <p>24 years old, brand-new <s>unemployed</s> graphic design
      graduate who's also done other stuffs.</p>
    <p>She's born <em>in Paraguay,</em> <strong>not</strong> Uruguay, 
      but she doesn't really mind when people get
      it wrong (Uruguay has better climate tbh).</p>
    <p>If you see her somewhere and she doesn't greet you,
      it's not that she doesn't like you, she just can't see well.</p>
